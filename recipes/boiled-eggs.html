    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Create perfect boiled eggs with this simple recipe. Start by placing eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan. 
    Cover them with water, ensuring they are fully submerged. Bring the water to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. 
    Allow the eggs to simmer for 9-12 minutes, depending on your desired donenessâ€”less time for soft-boiled and more for hard-boiled. 
    Once cooked, transfer the eggs to an ice water bath to cool and make peeling easier. 
    Peel, sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper, and relish these versatile, protein-packed treats as a snack or in various dishes.</p>
